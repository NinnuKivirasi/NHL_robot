How the robot should work:
    Start and find selected statics
        Go to place you find statics
            search results of NHL games
                save all game results that has been played past 24 hours on SQL
                save standing table than it is after this round on SQL
            search seleted players (from list included[finnish players listed])
                open file
                check players
                save selected players statics on SQL

    Save all results and statics, make readable file of it and send it to user
            great html file (or pdf etc) from the results
            send it to email (etc)
                
HTML file
